# BarBooks Coding Assessment

The project is using following technologies:
- UI
   - React
- State management
   - React Context
   - React Query
- Tests
   - Jest
   - Testing Library
   - MSW

To run the application use the command ``npm run dev``.
To run tests use the command ``npm run test``.

In the next iteration, I would put more work in:
- styling
   -  I haven't developed components and templates from scratch in my entire career.
      I haven't put much attention to CSS class names and class structure.
      I always used component and UI libraries like:
      Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material, Ant design, Carbon design system, PrimeReact.
- tests
   -  I made tests only for the Games component and useGames hook to show my testing skills.
      In a work setting, I would write tests for any logic that is worth covering.
